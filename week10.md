As the final week of the institute approaches I appreciated the opportunity I had to contribute to such a great project. Monday was just the prep day for the Symposium the following day. Me and my team were finalizing our power point that we were presenting and going over our lines and handoffs during presentation time. On the day of the presentation we were ready & when we presented we did a wonderful job. A couple presentations later & we were done, a whole 10 week program under my belt already felt good. Many oppourtunities came from just being a part of the program so I am glad I was put in a place where I could shine.
