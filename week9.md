This week the team implemented all of the final scripts onto the final greybox. We are moving towards finalizing our final paper and powerpoint. We also had the opportunity to assist the codebear campers in learning units within Unity. But this week has basically been the wrap up week for preparing for our Final Symposium and finalizing our project.
