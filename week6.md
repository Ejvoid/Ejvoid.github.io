This week has been focused on preparing for the Mid Summer Symposium. We have been going through practice runs for our presentations in front of our labs and mentors. We recieved alot of feedback on how we should present our projects which benifited us. Unfortunatley the Symposium was pushed back for next week but we will be even more prepared in that case. This week was good for me because I worked alot on my presntation and communication skills. I was able to demonstrate to my team and the lab that I know the ins and out of my projects and can talk about it in a room with people who has no idea what my project is. Overall it has been a productive week, we will resume developing our project further until next week.
