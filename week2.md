During the second week, my main focus has been trying to complete the Unity lessons. I fell behind due to technical issues but I wasnt feeling overwhelmed about getting the tasks done. I didnt feel that way because I truly enjoy creating the different types of games and having the oppurtunity to learn the ins & outs of game development.
While focusing on completing the units in Unity I completed about 3 units within 24 hours. My favorite game so far was in unit three. The concept of the game is to jump over obstacles that are spawning onto the terrain as the player runs foward. While programming this project I enjoyed the process of making the game look like something I used to play on my phone when I was younger. 
Some of the challanges I have faced this week were the technical issues. Items were taking hours to download and save. While also having my computer charger giving out on me and the new one taking a week to arrive, it was awful. I also felt like I was holding my team up because I was so far behind. I put my best foot foward to get whatever I can done with the time I had remaining.
Last week I had issues with the amount of tasks that were required to be completed but I am getting comfortable with the work load and I am definitley finding myself a rhythm. Back.
