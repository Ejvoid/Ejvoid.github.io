During the first week, We had a couple workshops on Python. I enjoyed relearnig the language. My group also went over our project and I must say I am very excited. Some things I am having trouble with is staying on top of all of the downloading I have to do in order to complete my work for the institute. This week I accomplished learning numpy & machine learning. They arent hard concepts and I enjoyed the workshops for them. Every mentor is nice and helpful, I like how the institute is organized. But overall this week has been very imformative, I can see myself enjoying the next nine weeks I have left for sure.
