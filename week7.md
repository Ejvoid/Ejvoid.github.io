This week went by failry quick. My team (The BCI team) was able to not only  get Muse LSL on unity, but we were able to see movement with a game object using the headset. We also had our Mid-Summer presentation this past Wednesday and it went well. I am excited for the end of summer presentations because I am eager to showcase our progress. But all in all this week has been very productive, spent most of the week just focusing on furthing our progress with our project and presenting what we did so far.
