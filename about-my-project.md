## About My Project
The concept of the project that I am participating in this summer is to allow a user to use brainwaves to complete a task. The task at hand for this project is to using the brainwaves to control a drone and to get it to play a game. The equiptment we will be using is called BCI or Brain Computer Interface. Using programming to allow a users brain waves to send signals to the drone so the drone and can excecute whatever action it is told to do.
