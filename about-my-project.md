## About My Project
Mind Mastery
Problem: Usually gaming involes physical use of a controllers, keyboard etc. This limits accessibility and the feel of being within the actual game for some poeple. The traditional way of gaming doesnt involve a players emotional responses or engagment while gaming. Not mention the individuals that can physically utilize controllers and keyboards properly due to an disability or condition. 
Approach: With using BCI, Brain Computer Interface, my team and I plan on integrating brainwaves into some sort of gaming system. The BCI measures electrical activiy within the brain. Using brainwave patterns that are associated with different emotional states. 
1. We will conduct research on alreayd developed BCI projects or research.
2. With the research collected from earlier stages in the process, the desgin of the interface will take place.
3. The development of different algorithms to help interpret and translate brainwave data into game commands and actions.
4. Preforming extensive test and making adjustments according to the new finds fromt the different trials.
Expected outcomes: Because this is a relatively new research topic any progression is what is expected. Having any progress with the research of BCI and gaming is expected.
Some problems that may present themselves are having the interface differ the different Brainwave frequencies and being able to correctly and efficiently execute the desired actions.
