This week our team was split up into two seperate teams tasked to do different things. I was on the BCI team which was tasked with the more program and coding based part of the game. We were tasked with finding a way to calculate focus, filter the different eeg signals so we can add commands from to signals, while also trying to get the gyro aspect of the game to work. We successfully were able to connect the headset and stream data from it. We were also successfully able to record and graph data from the Gyroscope. We are still trying to figure out a way to calculate focus, focus is important for our game because it impacts the speed of the game based off user focus levels. This has been a very productive week and Im looking forward to the breakthroughs that await within the next week.
