Durng week three, I was able to complete 6 figma pages and complete Literature reviews on three different papers. I found that reading about the different studies wasnt the most fun but it definitley was informative. Working alongside my team members to ensure that all of our presentations are up to par helped alot. Also learning how to artiulate and digest loads of information and turning it into my very own presentation is a skill Im glad I am learning within the institute. We also visited an Applied Physics Lab where I seen alot f projects I would more thsn love to be apart of. I was able to get a couple contacts and a couple good questions answered during the visit that excited me with my future more than ever. So far week 3 is the best week and Im excited to see that the upcoming weeks have instored for me.
