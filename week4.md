Week 4 was a very short week but I felt the most accomplished this week than from other weeks. This week the team met with our Highschool teachers and they seem very interested in what we are doing so I appreciate them for that. We also started on some game ideas and completed wireframes for those ideas. I wanted to create a Mario Brothers Wii type of game, my game design was called "Triple Quest". In "Triple Quest" the player must travel through three different biomes, artic, sand desert and a tropical rain forest. The goal of the game was to aquire three artifacts that then allows the user to get a reward, which marks the end of the game. We also went to NASA this week. We learned about the different technologies that they had for different Earth Sciences. All in all however this was another good week, I am getting better with getting my work done and time management. I am again excited to see what the upcoming weeks bring.
